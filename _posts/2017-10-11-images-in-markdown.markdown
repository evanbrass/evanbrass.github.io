Something I totally have to have in a blog is the ability to add images to a post.  With markdown it's pretty simple.  You just need the url or path to the file, and add this little snippet:

```
![<optional image title>](<image url or path>)

# Path example:
![Star](/images/full-star.pdf)

# URL image example:
![Halloween](http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2013/10/halloween-jack-o-lantern-AB.jpeg)

```

And here are the results:

![Star](/images/full-star.pdf)

![Halloween](http://cdn.history.com/sites/2/2013/10/halloween-jack-o-lantern-AB.jpeg)


For the path example, I added a folder called `images` in the root directory and stuck a file in there called `full-star.pdf`
